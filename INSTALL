Requirements
=================================
This application is merely written for Qt5. So better to compile it with
version 5 of below qt libraries.
Dependencies are :
    qt5-qmake
    libqt5-dev
    libmpv-dev

For instance to install dependencies under debian bullseye:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake libqt5-dev libmpv-dev mpv

Since the software is heavily using symbolic links, it is intended to only work with Linux.
OSX might also support it but I did not try that!

Build
=================================
Finally to build it inside source folder run:
    qmake
    make

Install
=================================
To install:
    sudo make install
